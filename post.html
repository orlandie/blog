        <h2>Let's start with an introduction...</h2>
        <p>Many people decide to switch to (or move toward) a plant-based diet for a variety of reasons, which can range from animalism to healthism to ethics and more. Generally there may be reasons that carry more weight than others for each individual, but a great many agree on all of them. This type of cooking may seem at first glance to be a great limitation, but it is not at all. Trust me and look at my recipes. You will learn about grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and seeds like you never imagined. You will begin to buy and cook vegetables and greens that might otherwise never have ended up on your table. To distinguish different varieties of the same ingredient. To know the seasonality of each product. And these are all wonderful aspects that will lead you to really know what you are bringing to the table.</p>

        <h3>For animals</h3>
        <p>The idea that someone might mistreat or kill a dog or cat makes us feel bad, but when we think about it, billions and billions of wonderful and intelligent animals are killed all over the world all the time, born and bred, however, to end up on our tables. Many of these come from intensive factory farms, where they are forced to live in extremely confined spaces, in terrible and unsanitary conditions.</p>

        <h3>To pollute less</h3>
        <p>The production of meat, fish, eggs and dairy products causes a very large percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, even more than that linked to emissions from all means of transportation combined. In other words: livestock farming pollutes, for several reasons. Animals must eat and drink every day, throughout their lives, before they become steaks: it is estimated that it takes about 2,500 liters of water to produce a single hamburger. Equivalent to about two months of showering a human being! In addition, factory farms pollute because of the methane gas emitted by the animals themselves.</p>
        
        <h3>For your health</h3>
        <p>The World Health Organization has declared red and processed meats carcinogens on par with smoking. There is no doubt that consumption of these meats is related to an increased risk of contracting cancer. In addition, vegetarians and vegans are less prone to overweight and obesity and are much less likely to develop cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p>
        
        <h3>For the cost savings</h3>
        <p>A diet rich in grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables (especially if they are locally grown and in season) is a huge boon to our wallets. Meat, fish and cheese are among the most expensive foods in the shopping carts of those who consume them. Eating plant-based does not mean eating only seeds, avocados, and quinoa, as many people think, but rather eating largely local, healthy, delicious, and, think about it, very inexpensive produce!</p>
        
        <h3>To get familiar with the food</h3>
        <p>This type of cooking may seem at first glance to be a great limitation, but it is not at all. Trust me and look at my recipes. You will learn about grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and seeds like you never imagined. You will begin to buy and cook vegetables and greens that might otherwise never have ended up on your table. To distinguish different varieties of the same ingredient. To know the seasonality of each product. And these are all wonderful aspects that will lead you to really know what you are bringing to the table.</p>
