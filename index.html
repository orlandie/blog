            <h2>Plant-based eating, why?</h2>
            <p>
                Many people decide to switch to (or move toward) a plant-based diet for a variety of reasons, which can range from animalism to healthism to ethics and more. Generally there may be reasons that carry more weight than others for each individual, but a great many agree on all of them. This type of cooking may seem at first glance to be a great limitation, but it is not at all. Trust me and look at my recipes. You will learn about grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and seeds like you never imagined. You will begin to buy and cook vegetables and greens that might otherwise never have ended up on your table. To distinguish different varieties of the same ingredient. To know the seasonality of each product. And these are all wonderful aspects that will lead you to really know what you are bringing to the table.
